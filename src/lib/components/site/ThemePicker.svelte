	// ThemePicker — lets a visitor pick any of Lily's 45 ready-made themes.
	//
	// Each theme is a standalone stylesheet (static/themes/<id>.css) that
	// styles every Lily component hook. Uses Lily's own theme-picker helper
	// (an icon button that opens a WAI-ARIA APG listbox) rather than a
	// native <select>, matching Lily's documented picker convention exactly
	// — see lily-design-system-svelte-theme-picker's own spec/index.md.
	//
	// The helper manages its own `<link data-lily-theme-picker="theme">`,
	// finding and reusing the one declared in app.html (which also carries
	// id="lily-theme" for the pre-paint flash-avoidance script there)
	// rather than creating a second one. Choice persists to localStorage
	// under the same "jph-theme" key app.html's inline script already
	// reads before first paint.
	//
	// Note: the helper's listbox is flat (no <optgroup> equivalent), so the
	// "Government & healthcare" vs "General" grouping the old native
	// <select> showed via <optgroup> is not reproduced — themes still list
	// in the same order (government/healthcare themes first), just without
	// a group heading inside the listbox.

<!-- Recommended by the package's own docs: the closed control is one

     assistive technology, and aria-live announces only on change, so
     it stays silent at first paint. -->
